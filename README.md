# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sophia Howard

I'm an M.S.-trained computational biologist with experience applying machine learning and structural bioinformatics to variant interpretation, transcriptomics, and drug discovery. I have a proven track record in early-stage biotech, contributing to IND submissions, clinical trial design, and high-throughput functional modeling. I'm passionate about building tools that enable foundational understanding of biology across scales.
